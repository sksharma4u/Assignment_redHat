Few remarks on Anagram Code:
----------------------------

1: I'm using a boolean variable to check for the condition that both string is anagram or not.\
2: I create the isAnagram method, which is used to determine whether the two parameters are anagrams or not.\
3: The fundamental requirement is that both strings must be the same length; otherwise, it is impossible for the strings to be anagrams.\
4: I stored each character in a char array and sorted the array by Arrays.sort.\
5: A1 contains the string s character, and A2 contains the string t character.\
6: If both Arrays have an identical character at the same index number at the end, it is an anagram and returns true, otherwise, it returns false.

Few remarks on Insert sign(+ , -):
-----------------------------------

1:The objective is to take the string 123456789 and add the signs + and - between the digits to make the new string's evaluated value equal to 100.\
2:The way the issue is written makes it possible to get the answer with fewer than eight signs, for instance: 1+23-4+56+7+8+9 = 100.\
3:My idea is to produce a run of numbers from 0 to 38 and display them as base 3 numbers.\
4:Here, we want three operators: +, -, and no operation (or concatenation). There are 8 of these positions (one less than the length of the string.\



----------------------------
Few remarks on Matrix codes:
----------------------------

1: I took the A and B 4 X 4 matrices.\
2: The transpose of both Matrix_M1 and Matrix_M2 is contained in these two matrices.\
3: Matrix_M1 and Matrix_M2 are the arguments which passes as a parameter in multiplication method.\
4: Multiplication method multiplies both the transpose matrix and stores the result in res variable.\
5: The display method will get the results at the end and print the matrix.
